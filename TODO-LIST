1) need to look at creating a context to pass around the isServer boolean (into header)
    this should be mapped to props, so needs to be passed down as part of props obj
2) start planning ahead a bit more
    - the GUI needs work, but maybe start the prototype and get some of the Queries & Mutations up and running
    - check out Ben Awad's CRUD video to see if there's anything that can be taken (not in Next, though)

1) Take a look at what the finished Link Feed component will look like, start from there
2) Make a quick list of the functionality it needs.
3) While looking at that, check out a couple videos on advanced/cool CSS stuff to add in... Pick one.
